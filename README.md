# Thinkful Data Analytics Capstone III: End-to-End Data Analysis Project

This final capstone project required students to create deliverables as specfied:
* A one-page proposal text document.
* A 5-10-minute presentation of your findings.
* A Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab) that tells a compelling story about the data.

This capstone project, I opted to use a dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/cpu-and-gpu-product-data) created by Michael Bryant which goes over PC chipsets and their various specifications. Attached in the repository are the Google Colab, word document proposal, and PowerPoint presentation I created for the project. I tested two hypotheses based on correlation between frequencies and transistor counts, as well as frequencies and GPU GFLOPS.
